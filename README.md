# Cantido

game's project based on __FLCL's anime fake game: FireStarter__

## Considerations & purpose

- this aim to make another version of this fake game
  - should be done quickly
  - hasn't yet some clear defined rules about how the game is meant to be played
- [TODO list](https://github.com/Hiswe/cantido/issues/1) 
- graphic assets will be made with the excellent [MagicaVoxel](http://ephtracy.github.io/) by [ephtracy](https://github.com/ephtracy)
  - simple voxel editor
  - can export in 3d format or png isometric
